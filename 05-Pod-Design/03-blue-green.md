# Additional Deployment Strategies in Kubernetes

## Overview
This section provides an overview of advanced deployment strategies in Kubernetes, focusing on Blue-Green Deployment and Canary Updates. These strategies extend beyond the default Rolling Update strategy, offering robust ways to manage application rollouts and minimize disruptions.

## Recreate Strategy
### Definition
The Recreate Strategy involves replacing the current application version by first removing all existing instances before deploying the new version.

### Key Characteristics
- **Downtime**: The application is temporarily unavailable during the deployment process.
- **Use Case**: Best suited for scenarios where downtime is acceptable, or the application state must be reset.

## Rolling Update Strategy
### Definition
The Rolling Update Strategy allows gradual replacement of old application instances with new ones, ensuring the application remains available during the update.

### Key Characteristics
- **Seamless Upgrades**: Instances are updated incrementally, maintaining service availability.
- **Default Behavior**: This is the default deployment strategy in Kubernetes if no specific strategy is defined.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for updates to container versions, replica counts, and configuration changes.

## Blue-Green Deployment
### Definition
Blue-Green Deployment is a strategy where the current version (Blue) and the new version (Green) run simultaneously. Traffic is routed to Blue until Green has been tested and validated.

### Process
1. Deploy the current application version (Blue) and route all traffic to it.
2. Deploy the new version (Green) alongside Blue, without routing any traffic.
3. Validate the Green version with testing and ensure it works as expected.
4. Switch traffic from Blue to Green by updating the service's label selector to point to Green's version labels.

### Advantages
- **Zero Downtime**: Traffic is seamlessly switched after successful testing.
- **Rollback Capability**: Allows easy reversion to Blue if any issues arise.

## Implementation Example
1. **Initial Deployment (Blue)**:
   - Deploy version V1 of the application with the label `version: V1`.
   - Route all traffic to Blue via the service's label selector.

2. **Deploying the New Version (Green)**:
   - Deploy version V2 of the application with the label `version: V2`.
   - Ensure no traffic is routed to Green initially.

3. **Traffic Switch**:
   - Once testing is complete, update the service's label selector to `version: V2` to route traffic to Green.

## Summary
Blue-Green Deployment and similar strategies provide enhanced control and reliability during application rollouts. They minimize risks by enabling parallel deployments and allow thorough testing before switching traffic to new versions. These strategies are ideal for environments where downtime is unacceptable and rollback capabilities are critical.
