# IP Address Management in Kubernetes

## Overview
IP address management (IPAM) is a crucial aspect of container networking. It ensures that every container receives a unique IP address while preventing conflicts and enabling efficient communication within the cluster.

## Scope
This section focuses on managing IP addresses assigned to pods and containers within Kubernetes networks, rather than the external node IP addresses, which are typically managed via external network solutions.

## Responsibility of IP Address Allocation
Kubernetes relies on the Container Network Interface (CNI) to handle IP address assignments. The CNI plugin ensures that:
- Each container receives a unique IP address.
- There are no duplicate IPs within the network.
- IPs are assigned dynamically according to predefined configurations.

## Storage of IP Information
To avoid conflicts, IP address information is stored and managed centrally. The CNI plugin is responsible for tracking allocated IP addresses and ensuring no duplication occurs.

## CNI-Based IP Allocation
CNI provides multiple plugins that facilitate IP management. The two main approaches are:
1. **Host-local IPAM**: Assigns IP addresses locally on each node while ensuring uniqueness across the cluster.
2. **Dynamic IPAM with External Providers**: Uses centralized databases or external controllers to allocate IPs dynamically.

### Configuring IP Address Management
CNI configuration files typically specify the range of IPs available for allocation. These files define:
- **Subnet range**: The range of IPs from which addresses are assigned.
- **Routing information**: Defines how network traffic is managed within the cluster.

Example CNI configuration snippet:
```json
{
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "name": "my-network",
  "type": "bridge",
  "bridge": "cni0",
  "isGateway": true,
  "ipMasq": true,
  "ipam": {
    "type": "host-local",
    "subnet": "192.168.1.0/24",
    "routes": [{ "dst": "0.0.0.0/0" }]
  }
}
```

## Address Pool Management
A common approach to managing IP allocation is through address pools:
- **Predefined IP ranges**: Dividing a subnet among different nodes.
- **Dynamic allocation**: Nodes request IPs from a centralized pool.
- **Peer-based allocation**: Nodes share a distributed database to ensure non-overlapping IP usage.

### Address Allocation Example
Consider a Kubernetes cluster where the IP range `10.244.0.0/16` is allocated to pods:
- Node 1: `10.244.1.0/24`
- Node 2: `10.244.2.0/24`
- Node 3: `10.244.3.0/24`
Each node further assigns IPs dynamically within its allocated range.

## Conclusion
Effective IP address management in Kubernetes ensures seamless communication and prevents conflicts. By leveraging CNI plugins, organizations can implement scalable, flexible, and efficient networking within their clusters.
